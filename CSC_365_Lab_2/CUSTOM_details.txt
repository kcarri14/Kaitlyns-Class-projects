Description:
    Table albums: This table is filled with the albums of Taylor Swift that she has made in her career
    Table albums_and_songs: This table is filled with the albums and songs from Taylor Swift. This does not include the singles or songs released without an album.
    Table all_songs: This table is filled with every single song that Taylor Swift has made.

Mapping Challenges:
    The data for all_songs had some missing dates in it so I had to maunally look them up and input them.
    The data from kaggle orinigally had 26 columsn in each of the data sets, but the extra info seemed irrelevant as it was talking
    about the beat, dancability, and features.

Information Queries:
    List all the albums
    Count how many songs are in an album
    Songs without albums
    Albums released after a certain date
    Albums with specific songs
